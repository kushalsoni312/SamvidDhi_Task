# SamvidDhi_Task
Created a ML model  for evaluating teaching assistant performance using the following steps:-
1) Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using tools like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
2) Preprocess the data by cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming it into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.
3) Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets.
4)Selected an appropriate multiclass classification algorithm i.e logistic regression.
5)Train the algorithm on the training set and optimize hyperparameters using cross-validation.
6)Evaluated the accuracy of the model.
7)Predicted the grade of teaching assistant by taking a new  attributes based on the model created.
